`pax` is a universal package management tool designed to make installing and managing dependencies in Python, C++ and R using Conda packages.

`pax` aims to provide AI/Data Science professionals the exceptional developer experience that is usually found with package managers like `cargo` or `yarn`.

`pax` is completely written in Rust and build on top of the [rattler](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler) library.

# Features

- Seamless integration with Python, C++ and R using Conda packages
- All os's: linux, windows, osx and osx-arm
- A clean and simple Cargo-like command-line interface.
- System-wide installation of Conda packages

# Installation

## Install from source
`pax` is 100% written in Rust and therefor it can be installed, build and tested with cargo.
To start using `pax` from a source build run:
```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/prefix-dev/pax.git
```
or when you want to make changes use:
```shell
cargo build
cargo test
```
If you have any issues building because of the dependency on `rattler` checkout it's [compile steps](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/tree/main#give-it-a-try)


# Usage
The cli looks as follows:
```bash
‚ûú pax
Usage: pax <COMMAND>

Commands:
  completion  Generates a completion script for a shell
  init        Creates a new project
  add         Adds a dependency to the project
  run         Runs command in project
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help

```
## Making a pax project
Initialize a new project
```
pax init myproject
```
Add the dependencies you want to use
```
cd myproject
pax add cowpy
```
Run the installed package in its environment
```bash
pax run cowpy Thanks for using pax
```
For more information check [the documentation](getting_started.md#basics-of-the-configuration-file)

## Installing a conda package globally
Next to having a project linked the folder its in, you can also globally install conda packages into their own environment.
This behavior is similar to [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx).
```bash
pax install cowpy
```
For more examples check [the documentation](./examples.md#global-package-installation-in-isolation)
