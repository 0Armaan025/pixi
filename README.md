`pixi` is a universal package management tool designed to make installing and managing dependencies in Python, C++ and R using Conda packages.

`pixi` aims to provide AI/Data Science professionals the exceptional developer experience that is usually found with package managers like `cargo` or `yarn`.

`pixi` is completely written in Rust and build on top of the [rattler](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler) library.

# Features

- Seamless integration with Python, C++ and R using Conda packages
- All os's: linux, windows, osx and osx-arm
- A clean and simple Cargo-like command-line interface.
- System-wide installation of Conda packages

# Installation
Install `pixi`:
```bash
curl ....
```

Or, build `pixi` yourself:
```bash
# Clone this project
git clone https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi.git

# Cargo install it to your system
cargo install --path pixi
```

# Usage
The cli looks as follows:
```bash
‚ûú pixi
Usage: pixi <COMMAND>

Commands:
  completion  Generates a completion script for a shell
  init        Creates a new project
  add         Adds a dependency to the project
  run         Runs command in project
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help

```
## Making a pixi project
Initialize a new project
```
pixi init myproject
```
Add the dependencies you want to use
```
cd myproject
pixi add cowpy
```
Run the installed package in its environment
```bash
pixi run cowpy Thanks for using pixi
```

## Installing a conda package globally
Next to having a project linked the folder its in, you can also globally install conda packages into there own environment.
This behavior is similar to `pipx` and `condax`.
```bash
pixi install cowpy
```
